# DirectXTex-rs

Rust bindings to Microsoft's [DirectXTex](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXTex)
library extracted from another project. Unpolished and undocumented but
should be functional. Expects a vcpkg installation of `DirectXTex` with the `openexr`
feature flag enabled. OpenEXR will be a feature flag eventually.
